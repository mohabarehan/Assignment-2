Social Network Centrality Analysis (VK Simulation)
 This project simulates collecting information about friends and friends-of-friends
 from VK for members of a student group. The goal is to build a social network graph
 and evaluate centrality metrics for the group members.

What the project does?
Creates a simulated VK-style social network.- Builds a graph using NetworkX.- Computes:- Betweenness Centrality- Closeness Centrality- Eigenvector Centrality- Prints results only for the members of the group (as required).- Draws a complete graph of all users (friends + friends-of-friends).

 How to Run?
 1. Install required libraries:
 pip install networkx , matplotlib
 2. Run the script:
 python 2.py
